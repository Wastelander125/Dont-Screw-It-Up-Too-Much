  - "Netty was born into a tax collector's family. Like her father. She graduated
    from economics school, but never made a living from finances. She retrained as
    a nurse. \r\n"
  - 'She then worked at a small hospital in Ohio. Her superiors described her as
    the average nurse who did not deviate and performed her duties as she was told.
    Always well recognizable by her red brooch.

'
  - 'Everyone who left the hospital spoke of Netty as a good nurse who cared for
    them and didn''t let them suffer for a moment.

'
  - 'But there is one mystery associated with her service. Very valuable spare parts
    have disappeared from a number of people who have died at the hospital. Just
    at her time of service.

'
  - But it was nice of her that she gave these deaths a little red brooch for the
    last trip.
