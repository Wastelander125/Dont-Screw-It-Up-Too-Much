  - 'Ben Jr. was born in 1925 to Ben Dover and Grace Dover. He spent his childhood
    in the small town of Little Falls in the middle of Minnesota. When he was 12,
    he moved with his parents to New York, where his father worked as a doctor and
    guardian.

'
  - When he was thirteen, he helped a classmate who was being bullied by an older
    boy. After all, they together started bullying that older boy. But you know,
    eye for an eye ...
  - From 1952 he began to get fabulously rich. He was nicknamed the Red Lantern Doctor.
  - st. Marie Hospital in New York was an amazing hospital founded by Ben Dover in
    1945. It's a shame what happened to it in 1951 ... Who ever heard of the hospital
    becoming the largest brothel in the country?
  - After high school, he successfully got into the NYU Long Island School of Medicine
    and after graduation in 1950, he followed in his father's footsteps as a doctor.
    It's a pity his father didn't live to see that day ...
