  - 'Hardy worked in Terre Haute Prison, where he played the role of an executioner.
    He ended countless destinies during his life. At first he felt sorry for even
    the biggest villains. But over time, he stopped feeling any emotion. He just
    did his sad job.

'
  - 'He also found a special fondness for this job. How many people can say they
    are executors? There was no cruelty in it, nor did he indulge in cruelty. He
    just liked a job well done.

'
  - 'He did not find a wife in his life and did not start a family. Who would be
    interested in an executioner? The killer?

'
  - 'He only cared about his grandmother. She was very ill at the end of her pilgrimage.
    It''s been a long time, but she interceded for his soul when his time came.

'
  - His soul is burdened, but he left in peace.
