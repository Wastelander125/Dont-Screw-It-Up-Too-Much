  - 'Jess was old grumbling even as a child. He couldn''t smile at anyone and kept
    away from everyone. He never helped anyone, but he didn''t hinder anyone.

'
  - 'He once stole a bird''s egg straight from the nest. But later he took care of
    bird mother all winter. The winter was harsh then.

'
  - 'He lovingly cared for his house, which he inherited from his parents. But he
    never invited anyone to him.

'
  - 'But one thing is fascinating about his life. As much as he did not like the
    presence of people, so he loved the presence of his plants. His garden was full
    of life. But which no one was allowed to see.

'
  - 'Anger and love in complete harmony.
