    birth, and in the church the pastor had forced her to kneel on a pea for all
    the mischief she had done. She was from the city of Perth, which was known for
    its fur farm and the oldest cat shelter in the country. The shelter was almost
    canceled once, but thanks to an unknown contributor, the shelter was saved.\r"
  - She once even committed the largest theft in the history of Perth. $ 5,000 disappeared
    directly from Mr. Kurt Rapplai's diamond-inlaid wallet. A local well-known mink
    fur trader.Nobody knows where the money will go. When Bella was caught, she didn't
    even have a punch. She didn't even have buttons in her tattered clothes.

    Europe. finally landed in Romania.
