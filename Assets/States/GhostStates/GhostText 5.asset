  - 'Harry had been a naughty boy since he was a child. He threw stones at cows,
    lit dog tails, and ruffled the girls'' hair.

'
  - Nevertheless, he was once celebrated in his city. Ice collapsed under the local
    mayor's son as he skated on the pond and could not get out of the icy water himself.
    Harry happened to be close and pulled the boy out of the pond. Then he received
    a great reward from mayor and could live as a baron for a long time.
  - 'The accident became a great mystery. Many people asked why the ice did not carry
    a little boy, but a burly man could run on it.

'
  - Harry never learned much from school and ended up as a salesman in a hardware
    store. He was not very pleasant to anyone, so the business was not very successful.
    but it was kind of enough for a living
  - Especially his big saws sold well.
